## Yooo 👋🏽

for a full somewhat-professional profile check out my [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahmatashari/), but at a glance:

1. data dev for oxy's upstream operations
2. code for fun, build arguably cool (although often seemingly useless lol) things

things i'm learning in 2024: 
- javascript (for the 4th time fr)
- d3.js

if you find me on twitter, don't follow. my commits and any actions recorded on this platform do not represent my professional affiliations.
